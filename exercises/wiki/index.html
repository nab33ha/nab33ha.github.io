					<p>Sho Shibuya’s New York Times paintings from 2020 interpret the chaos of the world and the beauty of each sunrise as an alternate, artistic historical record. From the start of lockdown, he began painting the sky from his Brooklyn apartment window as a daily meditation; using the front page of the newspaper for the first time as the country neared 100,000 deaths. Over months, gradient colour washes are punctuated by key dates that he interprets more graphically, with the series ending as Joe Biden gets elected president of the United States. Each composition is a personal expression, both escapist and all too real.</p>

					<p>New York City is home for Sho Shibuya. Despite its well-documented tribulations. Despite the fact he arrived there from Tokyo in 2011 with few words of English. Or perhaps because of all that.
A graphic designer in his professional life, and founder of brand design studio Placeholder, Shibuya’s been painting for five years now as part of his daily practice. But as NYC locked down due to COVID-19, he began depicting the morning’s sunrise on the cover of the respective New York Times. And helped define a moment.

In a time when the internet revealed, if only fleetingly, that goodness could reside there, too, Shibuya’s paintings appeared carrying a reminder we needed – of the sky that goes on existing. A benevolent provision, even to us who had forgotten to look up, in a location we’d be guaranteed to see it.

More than that though, says Shibuya, the feeling they evoke is a reminder of that place we can access inside. “The spirit of the project is that maybe, even after the pandemic subsides, people can continue some of the generosity and peace we discovered in ourselves,” he says.

Sometimes an image says it all. But we desired a glimpse into the process of this artist who captured a collective need. Generously, again, he obliged.</p>

					<h2>INSPIRATION</h2>
					<p>"I believed simple color and shape have power to influence emotions, and emotions influence actions. It is important to get the facts and understand the news, but I think my work is meant to make people feel the impact of the world beyond just facts and figures. It is similar to the way The New York Times printed all 100,000 names of the people who died from COVID; art can be a more impactful way of communicating the significance of the news."</p>
