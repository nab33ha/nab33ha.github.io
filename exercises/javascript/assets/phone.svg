Ye gives a look into the psyche of West, with the character of the artist being focused on.[28][52] The album includes references to the rapper's mental health, with a large amount of it seeing him unravel his mind, and "Ghost Town" is specifically linked to the theme.[53] The theme contrasts The Life of Pablo's delving into the darker corners of fame and family, with Ye being more uncomfortable in comparison.[28] West's bipolar disorder and suicidal thoughts are mentioned on the album, which are in relation to the theme of mental health.[29] According to Rapzilla magazine's Elijah Matos, the album is among the select mainstream examples of hip hop that examines mental health similar to the younger waves of contemporary emo and Christian rap artists.[54] Ye also includes West expressing his thoughts towards women.[53]

The album's opener, "I Thought About Killing You", sees West confess to thoughts of both suicide and homicide.[46] West delivers spoken word over a backing vocal within the opener for a couple of minutes until the beat changes and he switches to rapping.[51] "Yikes" includes West referencing his experiences with psychedelic drugs, as well as his struggle with mental health.[55] Within "All Mine", West moves "into more explicit territory" and raps about having interest in multiple dating options.[46][51] West uses "Wouldn't Leave" to reference his controversial comments about slavery, and his relationship with Kardashian.[51] "No Mistakes" includes a series of self-righteous outbursts, coming from the perspective of a multi millionaire in West.[50] The mind of the rapper is presented as being in the process of unravelling within "Ghost Town", which is in reference to his mental health state.[53] West raps about fears towards fathering his daughter within "Violent Crimes".[52]

On April 27, 2018, after West traveled to Wyoming and made subsequent album announcements, he announced the release of the track "Lift Yourself".[56] That same day, the track was released on West's website, with it seeing West rap nonsensical words.[57][58] West premiered a track two hours after "Lift Yourself" titled "Ye vs. the People", which features fellow rapper T.I.[59] During an interview with The Breakfast Club in May 2018, Pusha T claimed that a version of "Lift Yourself" with actual lyrics exists and indicated that it could be released on the album.[60] However, Ye was later released without the song included.[28] It was also rumored for "Ye vs. the People" to be released on the album, though the song ultimately wasn't part of it.[28][61] A song titled "Extacy" was part of the original track list for Ye as the second track, though the position was taken up by "Yikes" instead of the song on the final release of the album, while "Extacy" was later released under the title of "XTCY" on August 11, 2018.[62][63]

A two-hour listening party took place for Ye on the night of May 31, 2018, in Jackson Hole, with West broadcasting a livestream of the party through the WAV app.[67] West invited a variety of guests to the listening party, including Ty Dolla Sign, Kid Cudi, Nas, Pusha T, Desiigner, 2 Chainz, Big Sean, Cyhi the Prynce, among others. Members of Def Jam's staff mobilized and organized people from various locations around the world for the party, though the number of people originally planned to fly out for it was 300 until it was ultimately halved. At the location of the listening party, the album's title was announced as being Ye by American comedian Chris Rock, shortly before the party began. By June 6, 2018, West's official website had been updated to include footage from the listening party for Ye.[69] A promotional video of the listening party was played on the website, set to the album tracks "I Thought About Killing You" and "Ghost Town". Rock provided narration for the video.[70] West's website was later updated on October 22, 2019, in promotion of his ninth studio album Jesus Is King.[71]

There weren't any music videos released for Ye, but lyric videos for the tracks "All Mine" and "Violent Crimes" were officially released simultaneously on June 19, 2018.[72] Both of the tracks were treated as singles from the album with the promotion, despite not having been released as such at the time, though "All Mine" later experienced a single release.[73][74] The videos include the lyrics being written out on the same Wyoming mountain range displayed on the artwork for Ye, while the lyrics are in the same font used for the text on the artwork.
West initially debuted Ye on June 1, 2018, without any singles, as is popular among musicians using the sudden release option that don't want a big marketing roll out.[75] On June 8, "Yikes" was released to UK mainstream radio stations by West's labels as the lead single from the album.[76] Three days later, it was revealed that West had to choose a lead single in the United States for promotion.[75] Simultaneously, the song was revealed to have been selected by West for release as a single in the US.[75] It was serviced to US radio stations through West's labels as the lead single on June 11, 2018.[77] Prior to release as a single, the song charted at number eight on the US Billboard Hot 100, standing as West's first solo track to enter the top 10 of the Hot 100 since the single "Heartless" in 2008 and becoming his 16th top 10 single on the chart.[78] After having been released as a single, the song made its debut at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart, standing as West's 19th top 10 single on the chart.[79] On August 14, 2019, "Yikes" was certified platinum in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of 1,000,000 certified units.[80] The song was later certified gold in the United Kingdom by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for selling 200,000 units.[81]

West went on to select "All Mine" for release as the second single from Ye on July 20, 2018, which features vocals by Ty Dolla Sign and Clemons.[41][82] This decision was made by West due to his labels preparing a track for such a release to block a momentum loss for the album after "Yikes" experienced a lack of success on record charts.[82] However, the track's lyric video had been released in promotion over a month before it was selected for release as a single.[73] On July 24, 2018, the track was sent to US rhythmic contemporary radio stations through West's labels as the second single.[74] The track entered at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100, prior to being released as a single.[83] That same week, the track debuted at an identical position on the UK Singles Chart.[79] "All Mine" was certified double platinum in the US by the RIAA for pushing 2,000,000 certified units on June 28, 2021.[84] On March 6, 2020, the track was certified silver in the UK by the BPI for sales of 200,000 units.[85]

Both of the singles stood as West's first entries in the top 10 of the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart since "All Day" reached number six in 2015.[86] "Yikes" and "All Mine" gave West his 25th and 26th tracks to attain top 10 positions on the chart, entering at number seven and nine, respectively.[86] Though "Yikes" charted higher than "All Mine", the latter remained on the Billboard Hot 100 longer; it spend nine weeks on the chart, while the former only remained on the Hot 100 for five weeks
