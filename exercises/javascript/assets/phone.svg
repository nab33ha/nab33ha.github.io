My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is the fifth studio album by American rapper and producer Kanye West. It was released on November 22, 2010, by Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records following a period of public and legal controversy for West. Retreating to a self-imposed exile in Hawaii in 2009, he recorded the album at Honolulu's Avex Studio in a communal environment involving numerous contributing musicians. Additional recording sessions took place at Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank, California, and at Electric Lady Studios and Platinum Sound Studios in New York City.

The album was produced primarily by West, alongside a variety of high-profile producers such as Mike Dean, No I.D., Jeff Bhasker, RZA, S1, Bink, and DJ Frank E. Critical commentaries note the resulting music's maximalist aesthetic and opulent production style that utilizes various elements from West's previous work, including soul, pop, baroque, electro, and symphonic sounds, as well as progressive rock influences. Thematically, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy explores West's status as a celebrity, consumer culture, race, and the idealism of the American Dream. Guest vocalists on the album include Nicki Minaj, Rihanna, Bon Iver, Jay-Z, Pusha T, Rick Ross, Kid Cudi, John Legend, Elton John and Raekwon.

To help market the album, West released free songs through his weekly GOOD Fridays series and four singles – "Power", "Runaway", "Monster", and "All of the Lights" – all of which were top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100. West also released a musical short film, Runaway (2010), set to music from the album. In its first week of release, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and sold 496,000 copies, eventually registering three million units for a triple platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It has also been played at least one billion times through the music streaming service Spotify.

My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was an immediate and widespread critical success, and was named the best album of 2010 in many publications' year-end lists, including the annual Pazz & Jop poll of American critics nationwide. The album also won Best Rap Album at the 2012 Grammy Awards but was not nominated for Album of the Year, which was viewed as a "snub" by several media outlets. The album's hit single "All of the Lights" won Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. Widely considered West's best album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy has ranked in several professionally curated lists as the best album of the 2010s and among the greatest of all time according to NME and Rolling Stone. George Condo's accompanying artwork – illustrating West being straddled by an armless winged female (resembling a mythological figure) – has been ranked among the greatest album covers.
The album was conceived during Kanye West's self-imposed exile in Oahu, Hawaii, at Avex Honolulu Studio following a period of legal and public image controversy.[3] He said later that fatigue from overworking led to his controversial outburst after Taylor Swift was awarded Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. He was disgusted with the ensuing media response, which led to a hiatus from recording.[3] Amid the widespread negative response to his behavior,[4] his scheduled tour with recording artist Lady Gaga to promote his previous album, 808s & Heartbreak, was cancelled on October 1, 2009, without explanation.[5] The album's stylistic departure into downbeat and Auto-Tune sounds had also polarized audiences and diminished West's credibility in the mainstream.[6]

My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was recorded in sessions at Avex Recording Studio in Honolulu, Hawaii. Additional recording took place at Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank, California, and at Electric Lady Studios and Platinum Sound Recording Studios in New York City.[7] It was reported that West spent over $3 million provided by his record label Def Jam to record the album,[8] making it one of the most expensive albums ever made.[9][10] He later explained the initial recording process to Noah Callahan-Bever, Complex editor-in-chief and West's then-confidant, who said "he'd holed up in Hawaii and was importing his favorite producers and artists to work on and inspire his recording. Rap Camp!"[3] Artists who were reported to have participated in the sessions for My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy included: Raekwon, RZA, Pusha T, Rick Ross, Charlie Wilson, Big Sean, Cyhi the Prynce, Swizz Beatz,[11] Dwele, Nicki Minaj,[12] T.I.,[13][14] Drake, Common, Jay-Z,[15] John Legend, Fergie, Rihanna, The-Dream, Ryan Leslie, Elton John,[16] M.I.A.,[17] Justin Vernon, Seal, Beyoncé,[18] Kid Cudi, Mos Def, Santigold, Alicia Keys and Elly Jackson.[19] Record producers who participated in the sessions with West included: Q-Tip, RZA, DJ Premier,[20] Madlib,[21] Statik Selektah,[22] and Pete Rock.[23][24] Madlib said he made five beats for the album,[21] while DJ Premier said his beats were ultimately discarded.[24]

West, who had previously recorded 808s & Heartbreak at Avex, block-booked the studio's three session rooms simultaneously for 24 hours a day to work on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.[3] According to Callahan-Bever, who visited West during the recording sessions, "when he hits a creative wall ... he heads to another studio room to make progress on another song".[3] West never slept a full night at the "glass-enclosed mansion" he had rented, opting instead to take power naps in a studio chair or couch 90 minutes at a time. Engineers worked around the clock, as West bounced from room to room. This assiduous work ethic led to him employing two private chefs, one for hot and one for cold food.[25] Before recording in the afternoon, West and most of his crew played games of 21 against locals at the Honolulu YMCA for leisure.[3] Kid Cudi smoked marijuana in preparation and worked out on a treadmill, while RZA worked out in the weight room.[3][26] West held breakfast each morning at his Diamond Head residence for his crew.[3]
The music is described as maximalist by Jon Caramanica, who also notes East Coast hip hop elements,[31] and Rob Sheffield, who observes "hip-hop epics, R&B ballads, alien electronics, prog-rock samples".[32] Various writers also observe elements from West's previous four albums.[33][34][35] Entertainment Weekly's Simon Vozick-Levinson believes these elements "recur at various points", and include "the luxurious soul of 2004's The College Dropout, the symphonic pomp of Late Registration, the gloss of 2007's Graduation, and the emotionally exhausted electro of 2008's 808s & Heartbreak".[34] Sean Fennessey of The Village Voice writes that West had learned "the gifts of his handpicked collaborators" from previous studio albums and utilizes them here, sometimes to a heightened degree, "arranging orchestral majesty" (cf. Jon Brion on Late Registration) and "adapt[ing] DJ Toomp's oozing menace" (from Graduation) while "Cudi's moaning melodies became elemental" (cf. 808s & Heartbreak).[36]

The album is viewed as a culmination of West's past albums. Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork says, "Musically, [the album] largely continues where 2007's Graduation left off in its maximalist hip-hop bent, with flashes of The College Dropout's comfort-food sampling and Late Registration's baroque instrumentation weaved in seamlessly".[35] Andy Kellman echoes this sentiment, but adds that "it does not merely draw characteristics from each one of them. The 13 tracks ... sometimes fuse them together simultaneously. Consequently, the sonic and emotional layers are often difficult to pry apart and enumerate".[33] Kellman feels "All of the Lights" denotes the album's "contrasting elements and maniacal extravagance".[33] Conversely, Robert Christgau comments that the music abandons the "grace" of The College Dropout and Late Registration in favor of "grandiosity" and "sonic luxuries".[37]

The album is also described by music journalists as a work of prog-rap music, with Carl Williott of Idolator musing if it was "the world's first".[38] HotNewHipHop writer Samuel Allan regarded it as "a massive, paradigm-exploding piece of pop maximalism and prog-rap",[39] and Rolling Stone's Christopher R. Weingarten called it "a Pink Floyd–sized, King Crimson–sampling 68-minute prog-rap behemoth in the age of shrinking budgets".[40] Eric Sundermann of Noisey also referenced the album as prog rap,[41] and fellow contributor Phil Witmer regarded the album as "an unprecedented retreat by a hip-hop artist into the weird world" of 1970s progressive rock.[42] Al Horner from NME called it a rap opera.[43]
The album begins with "Dark Fantasy", opened by Nicki Minaj narrating in an English accent a retelling of Roald Dahl's poem Cinderella.[47] The song introduces themes of decadence and hedonism,[52] with West musing how "the plan was to drink until the pain was over / But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?".[44] The track's lyrics contain musical and popular culture references, including: the song "Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)", the Lamborghini Murciélago sports car, rapper Nas, fashion designer Phoebe Philo, the short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow", the song "Sex on Fire", singer Leona Lewis, and television character Steve Urkel.[53] "All of the Lights" incorporates drum 'n' bass breaks and brass fanfare.[44][54] West's lyrics contain a reference to the death of Michael Jackson in the opening lines and present the narrative of a character who abuses his lover, does prison time, scuffles with her new boyfriend, and subsequently mourns his absence from his child's life.[54] West enlisted 11 guest vocalists, including Alicia Keys, John Legend, Elton John, Tony Williams, Elly Jackson for the song; Rihanna sings the song's hook.[55] In an interview with MTV, Jackson said of the song's vocal layering, "He got me to layer up all these vocals with other people, and he just basically wanted to use his favorite vocalists from around the world to create this really unique vocal texture on his record, but it's not the kind of thing where you can pick it out".[56]

"Devil in a New Dress" is built on a sample of Smokey Robinson's "Will You Love Me Tomorrow".[49] Its lyrics are about lust and heartache,[49] with sexual and religious imagery described by one critic as "part bedroom allure, part angelic prayer".[57] It is the only track without production by West[7] but features his characteristic style of manipulating the pitch and tempo of classic soul samples.[49][58] "Runaway" features a piano-based motif comprising a series of sustained descending half and whole notes,[59] with a coda that incorporates light strings and vocoder-singing by West.[49] The narrator's self-critical lyrics reflect on his personality and character flaws.[60][61] Sean Fennessey cites the song as the point in the album where "self-laceration overtakes chest-beating", noting West's sung-line: "I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most".[36] Inspired by his two-year relationship with model Amber Rose, "Hell of a Life" contains a psychedelic rock sample and a narrative about marrying a porn star.[35][36] According to critic Ryan Dombal, the song "attempts to bend its central credo—'no more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need'—into a noble pursuit ... The song blurs the line between fantasy and reality, sex and romance, love and religion, until no lines exist at all. It's a zonked nirvana with demons underneath; a fragile state that can't help but break apart on the very next song".[35] "Blame Game" is a low-key track about a painful domestic dispute.[62] It features a sample of the piano composition "Avril 14th" by Richard D. James,[63] additional vocals by John Legend,[7] and a profane skit by comedian Chris Rock.[64]
