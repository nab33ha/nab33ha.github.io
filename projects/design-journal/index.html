	<div class="entry1"><a>(1) Tatsuya Tanaka<br>I first encountered Tanaka’s work on my instagram explore page under the art section. It was a thread of his surreal miniature storytelling works. I have always been fascinated by art that rescales objects, either into miniatures or monoliths.
Tanaka’s art isn’t meant for objective functionality, however I think it does allow the mind to repurpose the meaning and function of everyday objects, like the mask.  His work caters to people who find miniature art and surreal concepts entertaining. That includes me, he finds a way to completely change my perspective on everyday objects that often go neglected, and he creates a storyline on them. It's one of those things where the more you look, the more details you’ll find and enjoy. Miniature things are also psychologically proven to provide a sense of calm, and relief when you look at them. Which is why it brings me pleasure to orient my brain to tiny details.Miniatures are compact: They condense lots of intricate visuals within a very limited space. That richness of features makes them highly appealing to our senses. Research has shown that our gaze—and likely our touch too—is drawn to the regions of a scene or object that hold the most information. Part of our attraction to miniatures may be that they provide our sensory-seeking brains with highly concentrated dosages of tantalizing stimulation.
Something that also inspires me is his way of photographing and capturing the story. The composition and ratio of his items to the text teaches me a lot about how the weight of the text can help elucidate the content.
